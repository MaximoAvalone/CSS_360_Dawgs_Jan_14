## Individual Section – SDLC Choices and Justifications

The following table shows my individual SDLC model selection for each project, along with a brief justification.

| Project | Selected SDLC Model | Justification |
|------|------------------|--------------|
| #1 New e-Commerce Site | Agile (Scrum) | The project has evolving customer-facing features like customization and design options, which benefit from frequent feedback and iteration. Agile allows the team to incrementally deliver features while coordinating with the separate interpreter development team. |
| #2 Dental Office Site | Agile (Incremental) | The dentist wants flexibility and continuous additions over time with no strict deadline. An incremental Agile approach allows basic features to launch early while new capabilities are added gradually. |
| #3 Nuclear Power Plant | V-Model | This project requires high reliability, safety, and strict validation due to the risks involved. The V-Model emphasizes verification and validation at every stage, making it ideal for safety-critical systems. |
| #4 Department of Transportation | Waterfall | The project has a very detailed and fixed specification, experienced staff, and a clear timeline. Waterfall works well when requirements are stable and well understood upfront. |
| #5 Reducing Traffic | Spiral Model | This project involves new technology, hardware integration, and high technical risk. The Spiral model helps manage risk through repeated planning, prototyping, and evaluation cycles. |
| #6 Educational Game | Agile (Scrum) | Game requirements are evolving and feedback from teachers and students is critical. Agile allows fast prototyping, quick releases, and continuous improvement based on user feedback. |
| #7 Global Health | Lean / Agile | The startup is small, resources are limited, and requirements may change based on funding and real-world impact. Lean Agile helps the team deliver value quickly while adapting to changing needs. |
